    "project_context": "Festifriends is a mobile application built with Kivy and Python that allows users to create groups with friends for location sharing at large events, festivals, concerts, and raves. Core features include building squads, marking meetup locations, sharing individual locations, festival maps with event locations, event schedule pages, and safety features. The most important features are user logins, user databases, realtime mobile location sharing, database management, event maps, real world location to pixel coordinate conversions, group creation, and group management.",
